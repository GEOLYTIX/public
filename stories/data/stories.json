        "description": "A somewhat compact and small gallery, but it is ran very efficiently. You must book tickets in advance because they will sell out since they limit the number of people that can enter. Entry is done on the hour in shifts and you will have two hours to explore everything, which is plenty of time and you don’t need to rush. Be aware that no bags are allowed inside, I even saw smaller purses being turned away. There is free bag storage but it is outside the entrance to the left, so drop your bags off before getting in line. Excellent works by Caravaggio and Raphael, among others."

If your an art lover then you already know about the museum and your not going to miss it. If your an average tourist you’ll be able to see some great pieces that you can brag about. Like the birth of Venus."
