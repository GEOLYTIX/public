        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Last Updated: 14th June 2021</p>
        <p>Keeping your information confidential is of the utmost importance to GEOLYTIX.</p>
        <p>Relevant members of the team will only access your data when either analysing it because you've asked us to,
          developing features that use the data or user testing.</p>
        <p>We log all access to all accounts by IP address, so we can always verify that no unauthorised access has
          happened for as long as the logs are kept.</p>
        <h2>Registration &amp; Access</h2>
        <p>GEOLYTIX MAPP is an application built on our XYZ framework.</p>
        <p>When you register on the XYZ framework, you provide your company email address. This is so we can send you
          updates, or other essential information from time to time. We'll never pass on your personal info to third
          parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission.</p>
        <p>When you email us with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that correspondence, and the email address,
          for future reference. We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes
          sense.</p>
        <p>The only times we'll ever share your info:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
              involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or
              as otherwise required by law.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If GEOLYTIX is acquired by or merged with another company — we don't plan on that, but if it happens —
              we'll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
              policy.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Your Rights With Respect to Your Information</h2>
        <p>GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation (&quot;GDPR&quot;) in Europe, gives people under its protection
          certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us. Accordingly, GEOLYTIX recognises
          and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The rights under GDPR
          include:</p>
        <h3>Right of Access:</h3>
        <p>This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain
          information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</p>
        <h3>Right to Correction:</h3>
        <p>This is your right to request correction of your personal information.</p>
        <h3>Right to Erasure:</h3>
        <p>This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal
          information be erased from our possession (also known as the &quot;Right to be forgotten&quot;). However, if
          applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request
          may prevent you from using GEOLYTIX XYZ services and may result in terminating your access.</p>
        <h3>Right to Complain:</h3>
        <p>You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the
          appropriate supervisory authority.</p>
        <h3>Right to Restrict Processing:</h3>
        <p>This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed.</p>
        <h3>Right to Object:</h3>
        <p>This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Portability:</h3>
        <p>This is your right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to
          another party.</p>
        <h3>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making:</h3>
        <p>This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant,
          effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the
          decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European
          law, or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at
          support@geolytix.co.uk.</p>
        <h2>Law enforcement</h2>

          also encrypted.</p>

        <h2>Deleted data</h2>

          to this transfer.</p>
