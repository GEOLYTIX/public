        <h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>

        <p>Please see our separate <a href="https://geolytix.github.io/public/mapp/cookies.html" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a></p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Your information</h3>

        <p>We use the information that we collect from you to provide our products and services to you. In addition to this we may use the information for one or more of the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To provide information to you that you request from us relating to our products or services.</li>
          <li>To provide information to you relating to other products that may be of interest to you. Such additional information will only be provided where you have consented to receive such information.</li>

        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

        <p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Controlling your Personal Information</h3>

        <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>

        <p>If you want to opt out of marketing emails, you may do so by clicking unsubscribe in the email, or by emailing us at <b>info@geolytix.com</b>. If you are an existing customer and you opt out of marketing emails then we will still send you transactional emails.</p>
        
        <p>Transactional emails are necessary communications about your accounts and our business dealings with you, such as renewals and updates, and, as allowed by applicable law, requests for your participation in surveys.</p>

        <p>We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p>

        <p>You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to us.</p>

        <p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at the above office address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>The steps we take to keep your information private</h3>

        <p>Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in a kdbx (keepass) compliant file stored in our corporate google drive folder.</p>

        <p>Designated employees use keepass (windows) or keeweb (unix) for access. These are encrypted password managers which use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.</p>

        <p>The computers we use are protected by a passcode, fingerprint or strong password and have Bitlocker and Norton Anti-Virus installed. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or passcode.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Removing your information</h3>

        <p>At any point, you may delete your account, however as this is potentially very destructive (removing license authorisations for any sites you hold) we ask that you contact us if you wish to request this. We will also remove data linked to you stored with our third parties.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>How to complain</h3>

        <p>We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please email us at <b>info@geolytix.com</b>. If you’re the letter writing type, send your envelope to Sarah Hitchcock, Unit 117, Finsbury Business Centre, 40 Bowling Green Lane, EC1R 0NE.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Changes to the policy</h3>

        <p>If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.</p>
