The kids can't get enough of the outdoor activities - standup paddleboarding, coasteering, and just general hanging out by the sea at our favourite beaches of Marloes, Barafundle and Freshwater West. Other highlights include cooling down with a Pointz Castle Farm ice cream along the coastal path at Solva, and washing down a lobster roll at Cafe Môr with a well-earned beer from The Old Point House 👌",
